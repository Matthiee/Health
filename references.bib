  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Doctors of Chiropractic frequently give therapeutic exercise and nutritional advice to patients. Skeletal muscle's role in health and disease is underappreciated. Creating synergy between protein consumption and exercise promotes protein synthesis and may impact patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature describing protein metabolism and exercise as it relates to the practice of chiropractic health care. METHOD: The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the key terms protein metabolism, protein synthesis, exercise, whey, soy, and resistance training in various combinations. Limits excluded the use of papers that were not based on human subjects, included infants or disease, or were published before 1988. Thirty papers were ultimately included for analysis. DISCUSSION: The amount, type and timing of protein consumption all play critical roles in promoting protein synthesis. The intracellular mechanism behind protein synthesis has many interrelated, interesting components. CONCLUSION: An adaptation to exercise (protein synthesis) can be enhanced by controlling the type of protein, the amount of protein consumed and the timing of protein consumption. Doctors of Chiropractic may impact patient outcomes by using empirical evidence about protein consumption and exercise to maximize protein synthesis.},

  abstract = {Waking at night to void is known as nocturia and it is a common condition experienced by both men and women with profound impact on patient's health, quality of life, and economic condition. It is often perceived as a symptom of an organic disease, but the pathophysiology of nocturia is now well-understood, and it is considered as a disease itself. It is classified based on four different pathophysiologic mechanisms (24-hour polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, and sleep disorders). The association of nocturia with impaired quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality is well established. Various pharmacological agents are available, of which desmopressin is considered safe and effective in both short- and long-term studies for the treatment of nocturia in men and women, including the elderly. Combining desmopressin with other agents provides an effective treatment option for nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostatic hypertrophy or overactive bladder syndrome. This review covers the various aspects of pathophysiology and impact of nocturia, as well as the treatment of nocturia. We present the novel concept of a "nocturia clinic", which is a comprehensive diagnostic and management center for patients with nocturia. This set-up may help bring about a positive change in the underreported and undertreated status of nocturia, and bring relief to sufferers of nocturia. Therefore nocturia though perceived as a symptom of many disorders; it itself has a defined pathophysiology and needs treatment.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review the current state of knowledge on contributions of nocturnal urine overproduction and overactive bladder to the syndrome of nocturia. We review the recent literature and current state of the art in differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and classification of nocturia. We found that multiple pathologic factors may result in nocturia, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or insipidus, third spacing of fluid, sleep apnea, lower urinary tract obstruction, primary sleep disorders, and behavioral and environmental factors. Thus, nocturia may be attributed to nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine overproduction), diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Distinction between these conditions is made by a simple arithmetic analysis of the 24-hour voiding diary. Understanding the manifold origins of nocturia will lead to rational treatment of specific contributing pathophysiologic factors.},
